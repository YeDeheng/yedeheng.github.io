Short Bio: 
I am currently a Senior Researcher and Team Leader at the Tencent AI Department. 
<br>
Previously I was a research fellow at Microsoft Research Asia, working on the DKI (Data, Knowledge and Intelligence) area. 
I finished my PhD at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2016. 
My PhD advisers were Zhenchang Xing and Nachiket Kapre. 
During PhD, my research interest was software analytics, i.e., data mining in software engineering, including software-related text mining and source code mining.
I also did some work in parallel computing using GPUs/FPGAs.
