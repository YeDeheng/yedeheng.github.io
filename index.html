Short Bio: 
I am Deheng Ye (叶德珩), currently a visiting fellow at Microsoft Research Asia. 
I did my Ph.D. at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.
My advisers are Dr. Zhenchang Xing and Dr. Nachiket Kapre.  
I got my B.Eng. degree from the Gifted Class of Northwestern Polytechnical University, China. 
My research interests lie in software analytics, i.e., data mining in software engineering. 
I also did some work in parallel computing using GPUs and reconfigurable computing using FPGAs.
